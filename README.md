# Poster-
This is an informative poster I created analyzing effect of polio immunization rates on life expectancy using WHO Global Health Observatory Data.

Using Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO), I hypothesized that life expectancy would be longer in countries with higher rates of Polio immunization among 1 year olds. This dataset includes 183 observations of 22 variables. All data comes from the year 2015 and represent 183 of 193 countries initially mapped by the WHO. Data on 10 countries was omitted due to lack of information and difficulty of retrieving more data due to size of those countries such as Vanuatu, Tonga, Togo, Cabo Verde, etc.

My expectation is that there will be a clear positive correlation between life expectancy and the rate of polio immunization among 1 year olds which is important given the implications for other countries and how it could affect public health priorities around the world.
